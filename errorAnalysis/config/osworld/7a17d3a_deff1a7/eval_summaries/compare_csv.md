# `compare_csv`

## Purpose
Compare CSV files. If expected is a list, returns 1.0 if result matches any of the expected files.

Args:
    result: Path to result CSV file
    expected: Path to expected CSV file or list of paths to expected CSV files
    options: Additional options (strict, ignore_case)

Returns:
    1.0 if result matches expected (or any file in expected list), 0.0 otherwise

## Inputs
See function signature and task evaluator.result / expected.

## Matching rules
See return value in source (typically 0.0 / 1.0 or [0,1] score).

## Common pitfalls
Confirm expected rules in the task JSON; empty getter results often score 0.

## Pilot usage
- Tasks (1): 3aaa4e37-dc91-482e-99af-132a612d40f3
- Metrics module: `table.py`
- OSWorld commit: `7a17d3abc86d524420ea4ec96752f84d245fea74`

## Getter mapping
vm_file → get_vm_file
